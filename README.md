<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## The Process and What I have learned

### The Process
<p>
  Although I'm not active on Instagram, my close friend uses her Instagram to gain more followers for her business. I wanted to be a good friend supporting her Instagram, so
  I wrote a simple Python script to automatically like and comment on her picture.
</p>

### Lesson Learned
<p>
This was a very simple project I did. There were multiple libraries for Instagram automation, such as Instagram-Python, but I used InstaPy because it was straightforward to use and follow the documentation. When I have any questions, I learned to look up the documentation and try to implement and search the community to understand better.
